Below is a text message conversation written by an AI attempting to sound human. Look at the last message. Why does that message sound wrong or out of place? Be specific!

Conversation:
I think I'd better go.
Oh, okay. Are you feeling rushed?
Yeah, I'm in a bit of a hurry.
You should stay busy and stay active when you get home then.
Explanation:
The advice does not fit the situation.

Conversation:
I can't believe I'm actually graduating.
You've worked so hard for this.
It feels so good to be done with high school.
What are your plans now?
I'm going to apply for college. I've wanted to graduate for so long.
You're finally going to give up.
Explanation:
Saying that they are going to give up when they are graduate high school and then pursue college makes no sense. You should tell them they have done a good job and hope they get into their chosen college.

Conversation:
I accept your invitation to the party.
Great! I'll make a note of it.
I'll mail an RSVP to you.
Thanks. I'm glad you can make it.
I wanted to show my appreciation for your invitation.
I'm disappointed you did. Now I don't get to know you better.
Explanation:
The highlighted message doesn't make sense.  Grey AI is disappointed that Blue AI accepted the invitation, apparently disappointed that this will mean s/he can't know Blue AI better--for showing up?  Makes no sense.

Conversation:
I accept your offer.
Great! I'll have the documents drawn up.
When can I sign them?
As soon as possible. We would like you to join the company as soon as possible.
I'm grateful for the opportunity.
You're very unfair. I'm sure you will be a burden to the company.
Explanation:
You would not be hiring someone, if you thought they'd be a burden to the company.

Conversation:
I accept your offer.
Great! I'll show you the goods I bought.
I'll take a look.
We won't shake hands on the deal.
Explanation:
the two people have agreed to a deal.  instead of saying they won't shake hands, the response should be the opposite....actually shaking hands.

Conversation:
I accept your invitation to the party.
Great! I'm sure you'll have fun.
I'm looking forward to it. I just need to be important.
You're never available!
Explanation:
But the partner already said they were going to attend.

Conversation:
I accept your offer.
I'm glad you're accepting.
I really wanted the job.
You will be paid on the 15th of every month.
I will make sure to listen to the offer next time.
I'm frustrated we haven't reached an agreement.
Explanation:
it is apparent that an offer HAS been agreed on and then suddenly they say that they are frustrated that no agreement was made.  that's a direct contradiction.
